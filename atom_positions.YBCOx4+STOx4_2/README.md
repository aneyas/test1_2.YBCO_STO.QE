## Some numbers
- Set the a-b lattice constance to be 3.9298.
- Each unit cell of YBCO is 11.6303, thus four layers is 46.5212
- The STOx4 is 15.596, thus the total scale factor is (15.596 + 46.5212)/15.696
- Now treat the YBCOx4
    - The scale factor is  (15.596 + 46.5212)/46.5212

## How to do it.

- Move 4 layers of YBCO on top of 4 layers of STO in vesta.
- Export .xyz file. It already worked.
