The difficulty of this calculation is the convergence of the SCF loop.
I have done a few things to solve this problem:
	- Reduce te mixing_beta to 0.05
	- Change mixing_mode to 'local-TF'
	- Increase the mixing_ndim to 16.
	- Increase the number of nbnd by 8.

Things to be done:
	increase ecutrho etc.

Dr. Jia pointed out that my structure set up is wrong. It should be
Sr-Sr-Sr-Ba-Y-Ba-Ba-Y
